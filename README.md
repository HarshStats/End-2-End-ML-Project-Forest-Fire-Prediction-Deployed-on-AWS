# Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) Prediction Web App

A Flask web application that predicts the Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) for Algerian forests using weather and environmental data. The app is powered by a Ridge Regression model trained on the Algerian Forest Fires Dataset (2012). Users can input weather details to estimate fire risk instantly.

## üìä Dataset

- **Source:** Algerian Forest Fires Dataset (2012)
- **Records:** 244 instances (122 each from Bejaia and Sidi-Bel Abbes regions)
- **Features:** Weather observations (Temperature, RH, Wind Speed, Rain, etc.), FWI components, Region, and Fire occurrence (Classes)
- **Target:** Fire Weather Index (FWI)

---

## üöÄ Project Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Removed missing values and fixed column names.
   - Encoded categorical variables (e.g., Classes: 0 = Not Fire, 1 = Fire).
   - Added region codes (0 = Bejaia, 1 = Sidi-Bel Abbes).

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Dropped unnecessary columns (day, month, year).
   - Checked and removed highly correlated features to reduce multicollinearity.
   - Standardized features using `StandardScaler`.

3. **Model Training & Evaluation**
   - Trained and compared several regression models:
     - Linear Regression
     - Lasso Regression (with/without cross-validation)
     - Ridge Regression (with/without cross-validation)
     - ElasticNet Regression (with/without cross-validation)
   - Evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R¬≤ Score.

4. **Model Selection**
   - Ridge Regression and ElasticNet performed best and were saved for deployment.

5. **Web App Deployment**
   - Built a Flask web app for real-time FWI prediction.

## üìä Results & Visualizations

### 1. Feature Distributions

![Feature Density Histograms](feature_density_histograms.png)

*Takeaway:*  
Most features are well distributed, but some (like Rain) are heavily skewed. This helps understand the data spread and potential outliers.

---

### 2. Class Distribution

![Pie Chart of Classes](class_distribution_pie_chart.png)

*Takeaway:*  
There are more "fire" instances than "not fire" in the dataset, indicating a slight class imbalance (about 57% fire, 43% not fire).

---

### 3. Correlation Heatmap

![Correlation Heatmap](correlation_heatmap.png)

*Takeaway:*  
Some features are highly correlated (e.g., FWI components), which was addressed by removing highly correlated features to reduce multicollinearity.

---

### 4. FWI Boxplot

![Boxplot of Fire Weather Index (FWI)](boxplot_fwi.png)

*Takeaway:*  
FWI values are mostly concentrated at lower values, with a few high outliers, indicating that extreme fire risk days are rare.

---

### 5. Monthly Fire Analysis - Sidi-Bel Abbes Region

![Fire Analysis of Sidi- Bel Regions](fire_analysis_sidi_bel_regions.png)

*Takeaway:*  
Most fires in Sidi-Bel Abbes occurred in August and July, with very few in June and September.

---

### 6. Monthly Fire Analysis - Bejaia Region

![Fire Analysis of Bejaia Regions](fire_analysis_bejaia_regions.png)

*Takeaway:*  
Bejaia also saw most fires in August, with a similar seasonal pattern as Sidi-Bel Abbes.
